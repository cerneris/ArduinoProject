# ArduinoProject
Arduino + Raspberry PI lock project.

1. Flash the Arduino folder files to your Arduino.
  You need to get the Arduino library files, if you don't have them locally.
2. Plug the Arduino to Raspberry Pi using usb-cable.

3. Run the python script on your Raspberry Pi. You need to add a gmail account to the script.

4. Use the lock. (For testing, this is not a safe product).
